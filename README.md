# Text To Image Encryption
In today’s world of information technology data is everything and privacy has become a virtual myth. Whatever you have digitally isn’t yours anymore. Its lost in the ocean of data over the internet. So, the question arises how do we secure our data? To answer this we need to answer the question, “What is data?” In Simple word data is information with context. What is data according to you might not be data someone else. So, when we process information (raw data) it gets meaning as a whole and is said to be data. Coming back to the question how do we protect it? We protect it using cryptography: the science of writing and solving code. Cryptography has been there around ages, from Julius Caesar, to Nazis during world war 2 and till date we are using it. To name a few Caesar Cipher, enigma, DES, AES, RSA and the list goes on.
	In cryptography we convert data in unreadable (Ciphertext) form using some algorithms known as encryption algorithms. This Cipher text is then converted back to readable format using another algorithm known as decryption algorithm. In this paper instead of converting the data into unreadable text we would convert the data into an image.
